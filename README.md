# Apache-Tomcat-Webapp

This is a simple Maven webapp created to learn maven/tomcat. <br>
It serializes java to JSON and vice-versa using Gson.

## It has the following dependencies:
* Google Gson https://github.com/google/gson
* Tomcat7 plugin

## Things I learned:
* how to create a Maven project
    * maven project structure
* how to run CentOS on a VM while deploying a webapp to Apache Tomcat 
    * access via plugin and through installation/manager app methods
        * configure user settings for server access

## Running
* `mvn install`
* `mvn clean package`
